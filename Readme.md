📈 EduPerform Pro: Institutional Intelligence Suite
🚀 Project Overview
EduPerform Pro is a high-end, glassmorphic educational dashboard designed for institutional administrators. It moves beyond traditional tracking by using predictive analytics and a modern "Deep Space" aesthetic to monitor faculty performance, task completion, and attrition risks.

🎨 UI/UX Redesign Highlights
Unlike standard administrative tools, this project features a complete visual overhaul:

Theme: A premium Glassmorphic Blue palette utilizing semi-transparent surfaces and indigo glowing accents.

Animations: Implemented staggered "Slide-Up" entrance animations for a smooth, app-like user experience.

Layout: A unified container system that ensures all charts and text headers are perfectly aligned within glowing glass modules.

Responsive Sidebar: A sleek, dark navigation menu for seamless transition between intelligence modules.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Frontend/Backend: Streamlit (Python)

Data Processing: Pandas & NumPy for synthetic data modeling and variations

Visualizations: Plotly (Box Plots, Radar Charts, Donut Charts, and Scatter Plots with OLS Trendlines)

Styling: Advanced Custom CSS (Keyframes, Backdrop-filters, and Radial Gradients)

📋 Intelligence Modules
1. Executive Summary (Dashboard)
Animated KPIs: Real-time tracking of Staff Strength, Retention Risk, and Efficiency Indices.

Distribution Analysis: Inter-departmental performance box plots.

Operational Pulse: Interactive donut charts for task completion monitoring.

2. Faculty Analytics
Individual Profiles: Dynamic member selection with automated avatar generation.

Pedagogical Competency Wheel: Radar charts analyzing skills across 5 categories: Tech, Engagement, Curriculum, Assessment, and Feedback.

3. Risk & Attrition Analysis (New Interactive Features)
Risk Sensitivity Slider: Allows administrators to adjust the threshold for identifying "at-risk" staff.

Departmental Filters: Dynamic bar charts to isolate lateness distribution by specific departments.

Predictive Correlation: Scatter plot with an OLS trendline showing the statistical impact of lateness on performance scores.

🧠 Data Variation & Logic
As per project requirements, the dataset has been modified by over 20% compared to standard templates:

Staff Strength: Increased to 62 active members.

Incident Log: Adjusted to 112 monthly instances.

Logic: High lateness counts are modeled to correlate with a higher attrition risk, providing realistic administrative insights.
